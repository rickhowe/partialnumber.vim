INTRODUCTION                                           *partialnumber*

This plugin shows the line number partially for a specified range with an
optional highlight group in the sign column.

While running some plugin or your vimrc, you might have seen such an error
message:
>
 Error detected while processing function MyFunc1:
 line   37:
 E727: Start past end

 Error detected while processing function MyFunc2:
 line   61:
 E684: list index out of range: 19
<
Even if 'number' and 'relativenumber' options are used in a window, it is not
easy to identify where those errors have happened in the functions.

In addition, when debugging your vim script, you can specify the line number
for a function as a breakpoint in the |:breakadd| and |:breakdel| commands and
also can see the hierarchy of the function call including the line number in
the |:backtrace| command. But those line numbers are relative to the start of
the function.

By using this plugin, for example,
>
 :g/^\s*\<fu\%[nction]\>/+1,/^\s*\<endf\%[unction]\>/-1 SetPNU
<
will assign and show the line numbers for each function individually so that
you can see those relative line numbers in the sign column.

The highlight group (default: |hl-SignColumn|) can be used to differently show
the partial line numbers with its highlight.

Since the vim's sign feature allows to use just 2 columns, the lower 2 digits
of the line number are displayed in each line. In each 100th line until 900th,
its abbreviated number is displayed such as '1+' or '9+'. And '++' is
displayed in other 100th lines.

To save the column space, it is useful to set 'signcolumn' option to "number"
and puts them in the number column, if possible.

When some lines are added or deleted while showing the partial line numbers,
this plugin will try to follow those changes and update the line numbers.
